# Exercise: Variables Practice

Complete the tasks in order.

## Part A: Build a player status file

Create `my_status.py` with these variables:

- `player_name`
- `score`
- `lives`
- `level`

Print all values like this style:

```python
print("Name:", player_name)
```

Run:

```bash
python3 my_status.py
```

---

## Part B: Update values

In the same file, add:

- one line that increases score by 20
- one line that decreases lives by 1
- print the updated values

---

## Part C: Fill in the blanks

Complete this code:

```python
player_name = "Luna"
score = __
lives = __

score = score + __
lives = lives - __

print("Player:", ________)
print("Score:", ________)
print("Lives:", ________)
```

---

## Part D: Fix the bugs

Fix this code so it runs:

```python
player name = "Rex"
score == 0
lives = 3
print("Name:", player_name)
print("Score:", score)
```
