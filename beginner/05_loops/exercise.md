# Exercise: Loop Practice

Complete each part in order.

## Part A: Countdown with while

Create `countdown.py`:

1. Start with `time_left = 5`
2. Use `while` to print countdown until 1
3. Print `"Go!"` after loop ends

---

## Part B: Three game turns

Create `three_turns.py`:

1. Set `turn = 1`
2. Use a `while` loop for 3 turns
3. Ask player for move each turn
4. Print the move

---

## Part C: For loop stars

Create `stars.py`:

Use `for` and `range` to print:

```text
Star 1
Star 2
Star 3
Star 4
Star 5
```

---

## Part D: Fill in the blanks

```python
turn = 1
while turn ____ 3:
    print("Turn", turn)
    turn = turn + __

for step in ______(1, 4):
    print("Step", step)
```

---

## Part E: Fix the bugs

Fix this code so it runs correctly:

```python
score = 0
while score < 30
    print("Score:", score)
    score = score + 10

for i in range(1 4):
print(i)
```
