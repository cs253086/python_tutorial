# Lesson 00: Start Python in Your Browser

Welcome to your first Python mission.

In this lesson, you will:
- use the in-browser Python console on the lesson page
- run your first Python code
- edit code and run it again

This lesson is for complete beginners. Go slowly and celebrate each step.

## 1) Open the lesson webpage

Open the beginner lesson website in your browser.

On each lesson page, you will see a panel called:

**Python Playground**

That panel is your coding area.

---

## 2) Find the console panel

In the right-side panel:

- code editor box
- **Run code** button
- **Reset code** button
- output area

You do not need to install Python for this lesson track.

---

## 3) Run your first code

In the code editor, type:

```python
print("Hello from Python!")
```

Click **Run code**.

You should see:

```text
Hello from Python!
```

---

## 4) Change and run again

Now change the code to:

```python
print("Hello, I am learning Python!")
print("My first mission is complete.")
```

Click **Run code** again.

When output changes, your code is working.

## 5) Use Reset button

**Reset code** puts the lesson’s default starter code back in the editor. Click it when you want to start over; then click **Run code** to run it.
