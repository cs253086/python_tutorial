# Lesson 00: Start Python in Your Browser

Welcome to your first Python mission.

In this lesson, you will:
- use the in-browser Python console on the lesson page
- run your first Python code
- edit code and run it again

This lesson is for complete beginners. Go slowly and celebrate each step.

---

## 1) Open the lesson webpage

Open the beginner lesson website in your browser.

On each lesson page, you will see a panel called:

**Try Python in your browser**

That panel is your coding area.

---

## 2) Find the console panel

In the right-side panel:

- code editor box
- **Run code** button
- **Reset code** button
- output area

You do not need to install Python for this lesson track.

---

## 3) Run your first code

In the code editor, type:

```python
print("Hello from Python!")
```

Click **Run code**.

You should see:

```text
Hello from Python!
```

---

## 4) Change and run again

Now change the code to:

```python
print("Hello, I am learning Python!")
print("My first mission is complete.")
```

Click **Run code** again.

When output changes, your code is working.

---

## 5) Use Reset button

If you want to go back to the lesson starter code:

1. Click **Reset code**
2. Click **Run code**

This is useful when you test many ideas.

---

## Common problems and fixes

### Problem: runtime is loading for too long

Wait a few seconds first.
If needed, refresh the page and try again.

### Problem: no output

Make sure your code uses `print(...)`.

### Problem: syntax error

Check:
- missing quotes
- missing `)`
- typo in command name

Errors are normal for programmers.

---

## New words

- **Browser**: app used to open webpages
- **Console**: area where you run code
- **Output**: result shown after code runs
- **Runtime**: engine that executes code

---

## Mission complete when...

- [ ] I found the right-side Python console
- [ ] I ran `print("Hello from Python!")`
- [ ] I changed code and ran it again

Great start. Next lesson: printing and strings.
