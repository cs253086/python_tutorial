# Optional Challenge: Terminal Explorer

Try these bonus tasks if you finished the main exercise.

## Challenge 1: Make your own greeting

Create a file named `my_intro.py`:

```python
print("Hi, my name is ...")
print("My favorite game is ...")
print("I am ready to learn Python!")
```

Run it with:

```bash
python3 my_intro.py
```

## Challenge 2: Change and rerun

Edit one line in `my_intro.py`, then run it again.
Notice how changing code changes output.

## Challenge 3: Mini command quiz

Write answers without looking:

1. Install Python on Ubuntu: `____________________`
2. Check Python version: `____________________`
3. Run a file called `hello.py`: `____________________`

## Bonus idea

Ask your child to teach these 3 commands to a parent or sibling.
If they can teach it, they really learned it.
