# Lesson 01: First Program with `print()`

Welcome to lesson 01.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:
- show text on the screen with `print()`
- write string text correctly
- run code in the Python Playground

At the end, you will make the first part of your game: a welcome screen for **Treasure Hunt**.

---

## What is `print()`?

`print()` is a Python command that shows text on the screen.

Example: in the Playground editor, type:

```python
print("Hello!")
```

Click **Run code**. The output area will show:

```text
Hello!
```

---

## 1) Your first program in the Playground

In the Playground editor, type:

```python
print("Welcome to Treasure Hunt!")
print("You are a brave explorer.")
print("Let's find the hidden treasure!")
```

Click **Run code**.

If you see 3 lines of output, mission success.

---

## 2) Strings: text inside quotes

In Python, text is called a **string**.

Strings must be inside quotes:

```python
print("This is a string")
```

You can use double quotes `"` or single quotes `'`:

```python
print("Treasure")
print('Treasure')
```

Both are valid.

## 3) Game mini-step: intro screen

In the editor, type:

```python
print("================================")
print("      TREASURE HUNT GAME")
print("================================")
print("Goal: Find treasure before you run out of lives.")
print("Good luck, explorer!")
```

Click **Run code**.

You just built the first screen of your game.
